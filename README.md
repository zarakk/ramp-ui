# RampUI 

RampUI is a demo version web application built using NextJS that demonstrates a demo version of the website Ramp. The application was built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. 

## Project Structure

The project follows a directory structure to organize its files and components. Here's an overview:

- `app/`: Contains Next.js routes. Each `.tsx` file in this directory corresponds to a specific route.
- `_components/`: This directory holds reusable components used throughout the application. You can create subdirectories here based on your component organization.
- `Types/`: Contains all types used in the web application.
- `Constants/`: Contains all constants and arrays used in the web application
- `public/`: Store static assets such as images, fonts, and other files. These assets can be accessed directly via URLs (e.g., `/public/logo.png`).


## If you want to run it locally: 

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
